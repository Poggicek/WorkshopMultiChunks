# WorkshopMultiChunks

A simple hack that makes the workshop manager create vpks split into multiple chunks, the game loads those fine and this allows you to exceed the 2.0GB map limit.

This has to be used in combination with a few patches in the workshop manager that are not included in the library.

Most importantly a 0 must be replaced with a 1 to enable multichunk vpks.

Then only 2 patches are required to remove the 2GB hard coded limits, those are very simple to find and remove
